# Homework-4

This is my solution to the Coding Quiz Challange!

I got my question choices from w3Schools and some google searches.

The most difficult part is getting the list of highscores and user's initials to log in the console and display on a different page when I click the Highscored button. 
-I don't think what I have there for this part is quite right.
